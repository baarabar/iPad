                    <h4>Arredo</h4>
                    <p>Arredo was planning an expansion of their ecommerce but they were having trouble scaling their investment without losing returns and campaign performance.</p>
                    <p>We made a deep dive to understand which channels were having the best ROAS in order to come up with an efficient way to distribute their budget into the most efficient web properties. They stabilized their investment and performance and saw results in less than 180 days without losing significant returns.</p>

                <div class="case">
                    <h4>Supervielle</h4>
                    <p>They needed to grow the share of online channels and wanted to achieve this by lowering their cost per acquisition.</p>
                    <p>We started by creating from scratch a whole new media plan that included Google Ads and Facebook Ads, and relocating the budget for each platform. Thanks to the brand awareness we had with Supervielle we lowered their ROAS investment 160% without losing performance, managing to decrease their cost per acquisition by 12%.</p>
